      <h2>CASE STUDY: SOUDAN IRON MINE, Soudan, MN</h2>
        <img src="Soudan_Mine_Panorama.png" alt="soudan iron mine" style="width:100%">
        <p>The Soudan Underground Mine (SUM) near Soudan, MN is a prime example of where biology and geology have interacted
          in the Minnesota's past. The SUM contained economically viable iron ore with an abundance of nearly pure iron-ore.
 Mining of iron began at this site in 1882, first as an open pit mine, then as an 
          underground mine. The SUM operated in Northern Minnesota from 1901 until mining operations ceased in 1962, when 
          competition from the much cheaper taconite mining industry put them out of business because it was too expensive 
          to be profitable<sup>1</sup>. Currently the mine 
          exists as part of Soudan Underground state park in Northern Minnesota and provides a rare opportunity to study a 
          Banded Iron Formation (BIF), associated aquifer water chemistry, and the life forms that live deep underground 
          that seep out through the boreholes.</p>

        <p>In abandoned mine shafts, the SUM system 
            contains signs of modern microbial life<sup>2</sup>.These signs hint at a complex story of microbes and 
          fluid as an important biogeochemical system relating to the ~2.7 Ga rocks. A series of boreholes located on the 
          27th level continue to vent water. Microorganisms are visible growing near these boreholes and along the surface 
          of the water in several locations. These microbes can provide a window into the biology of the early Earth. Currently the mine 
          exists as part of Soudan Underground state park in Northern Minnesota and provides a rare opportunity to study a

        <p>
Banded Iron Formations are sedimentary rocks composed of alternating bands of iron-rich and silica-rich mineral layers. 
            Minnesota was the bottom of an ocean around 2.7 Ga. 
            In that deep water setting, subaqueous volcanoes erupted and drove the circulation of high temperature fluids 
            through thick stacks of volcanic rocks. At high temperatures, this circulation also drove the leaching of 
            elements,  Hot fluids (~35o degrees celsius)<sup>3</sup> that were released from the Earthâ€™s mantle through 
            hydrothermal vents leached out many elements such as ferrous iron and H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> from 
            the host volcanic rocks and 
            into a solution. By upward convection, the hydrothermal fluids eventually hit cool layers of ocean water.
            The high thermal gradient causes elements in solution to precipitate onto the seafloor due to conductive 
            cooling, resulting in the formation of the Si-Fe-rich chemical sedimentary layers. When the solution comes 
            into contact with cooler seawater, the H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> precipitates out of it. 
            For Fe<sup>2+</sup> in solution, with the exception 
            of solutions of a high acidity, as soon as the solution comes into contact with oxygen, Fe<sup>3+</sup> will be created 
            from the Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The hydrothermal circulation occuring during the Archean, allowed for a large reservoir of 
            Soluble Iron(II) (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to build up in the oceans. The iron rich layer of BIFs formed when the Fe(II) was 
            oxidized to Fe(III), causing it to precipitate into the sediment. There are three main ways iron could have
           been oxidized: (1) oxidation catalyzed by bursts of UV radiation, (2) oxidation when Fe(II) contacts pockets 
            of oxygenated waters made by early oxygenic photosynthesizers, or (3) direct oxidation by iron-oxidizing
            microorganisms. The iron 
            formation at Soudan is possibly a record of microbial evolution occurring at the time.
