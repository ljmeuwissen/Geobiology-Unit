<h2>13.5 Billion years ago: The Big Bang!</h2>
      <p>The universe began with a massive explosion that generated space and time, along with all of the matter and 
          energy in the universe. It is unknown what caused this explosion, but it may have been inflation. 
          At this point in time, there were no particles 
        such as protons, neutrons, bosons, neutrinos, or electrons. This means that atoms did not exist because there was 
          nothing to make them out of.</p>

      <h2>about 9 billion years after the Big Bang</h2>
        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">about 5 billion years before now</h2>
        <p><b>The solar system begins to form.</b> It started as a "nebula", or cloud of gas and dust. It contained mostly 
        hydrogen and helium, but also a small amount of heavier atoms which were created by a supernova explosion. The nebula 
        started to collapse in on itself and was drawn together due to gravity. The particles of dust and gas inside the
        nebula smashed into each other and created larger and larger particles. The nebula continued to collpase and started 
        to rotate. The majority of the nebula's mass was drawn to the center of the cloud.
      </p>
        <p>As gravity continued to pull matter into the center of the disk, the density and pressure became great enough for 
            nuclear fusion to begin. The sun was born!</p>

    <div class="content">
  
      <p>As the outer parts of the disk started cooling off, matter started to condense and clump together. Eventually, as 
          more and more matter clumped together, larger clumps called planetesimals formed. Planetesimals continued to clump 
          together until protoplanets formed and then protoplanets collided and formed the planets. Rocky, or terrestrial, 
          planets formed closer to the Sun and gas planets formed farther away from the sun. This happened because solar wind blew
          most of the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, into the outer solar system, leaving behind heavier elements 
          and even some organic molecules for the terrestrial planets to form out of. </p>
